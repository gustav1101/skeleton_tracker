# Installation of third party libraries
## catch_ros
catch_ros is a wrapper for the [catch2 testing suite](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2). It is, at time of writing this, supported under version 2.4 (which is already outdated, stand right now is 2.11, but it's still better than the alternatives). The [original ros wrapper](https://github.com/AIS-Bonn/catch_ros) has been [forked](https://github.com/gustav1101/catch_ros) to make sure it doesn't suddenly disappear.

For installation, simply clone the repository into the catkin workspace.
